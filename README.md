#### JuliaMono, a font for programming

You can download the JuliaMono fonts [here](https://github.com/cormullion/juliamono).

The size of that repository is kept deliberately small. So everything else is in this repository.

The source files are in Glyphs3 format.

The SIL Open Font License (SIL/OFL) basically says you can do whatever you like with the font except:

- sell it

- use a different (non-SILOFL)

- use the reserved name "JuliaMono"
