#### JuliaMono, a font for programming

You can download the JuliaMono fonts [here](https://github.com/cormullion/juliamono).

The size of that repository is kept deliberately small. 

This repository contains the source files (in `.glyphs` format) and the source files for the website (https://juliamono.netlify.app).

The SIL Open Font License (SIL/OFL) basically says you can do whatever you like with the font and its source, including issuing it under a new name, but you can't:

- use the reserved name "JuliaMono"

- sell it on its own  (but it can be sold with other software)

- use a different (non-SIL/OFL) licence for any derivative works

*If you want to suggest changes to the website in a PR, please make the suggested changes to the files outside the `/website/__source/` directory, and then rebuild the site, using [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl). The files inside the `__source` directory are overwritten each time the site is built.*
